# autoexpense
This script analyzes your expenses for you from multiple banking institutions. It is often challenging to track expenses and spending habits efficiently if you have multiple credit cards from different banks since they all give you a different statement.

Benefits of script
- Automatically categorizes spend for you based on similarity of previous merchants you used
- Creates a continuous tracking of your spending habits
- Do not need to manually enter spending data
- Opportunity for automated visualizations of your spending habits

Requirements:
- Python + difflib and pandas libraries
- Create a folder called 'statements_to_analyze'
- Download your statements in csv or excel into the above folder

Instructions:
- Run the script with your credit card statements in the 'statements_to_analyze' folder
- Use the saved_expense_data.csv output file to analyze your expenses in excel or build your own visualization script with Plotly/Dash
